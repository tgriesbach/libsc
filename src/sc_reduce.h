/** \file sc_reduce.h
 * Self-contained implementations of MPI_Reduce and MPI_Allreduce.
 *
 * Our motivation for writing these alternatives is reproducible
 * associativity.  With this implementation, the associativity of the
 * reduction operation depends on the size of the communicator only and does
 * not suffer from random or otherwise obscure influences.
 *
 * Both algorithms use a binary communication tree.
 * We provide implementations via a customizable reduction operator
 * as well as drop-in replacements for minimum, maximum, and sum.
 * We do not currently support user-defined MPI datatypes.
